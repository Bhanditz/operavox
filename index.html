	<h1>Operavox</h1>
	<p>
		Operavox is a accessibility extension for Opera Android products which makes
		use of Android's Talkback framework to provide accessibility support.
	</p>

	<h2>Getting the Source</h2>
	<p>
		The current development snapshots and source is available at Opera Software's
		<a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/chromevox">Chromevox</a> repository
		and <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operavox">Operavox</a> repository.
	</p>

	<h2>Versions</h2>
	<p>
		The versions listed here are only published for reference and testing purposes. While
		the actual published versions are identical to the releases provided here, official
		releases will use our official distribution channel instead of the Github static page.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="1.0/operavox.js">1.0</a> for Opera Devices SDK {{TBD}} and Opera Mobile {{TBD}} for Android</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Testing</h2>
	<p>
		To test against a specific version, you will need to copy the URL of a version
		listed above and initialize with the flag <code>accessibility-js-url</code> set
		to the URL of the version that you are testing against. A mismatching version may
		work or result in completely undesired behavior. Please note that our internal
		testing is only done against matching versions.
	</p>
	<p>
		A example would be:
	</p>
	<pre>--accessiblity-js-url=https://operasoftware.github.io/operavox/1.0/operavox.js</pre>
	<p>
		Depending on the version, the extension may or may not work on Chrome for Android.
	</p>
